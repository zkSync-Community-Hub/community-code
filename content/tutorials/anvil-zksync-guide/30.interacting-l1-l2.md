## **Next Steps**  

ðŸŽ¯ **Verify Balance Changes** â†’ After sending transactions and deploying contracts, check the paymaster's balance to confirm it covered the fees:  

```sh
cast balance 0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF --rpc-url anvil-zksync | cast from-wei
```

[ZKsync Paymaster Docs](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/unique-features/paymaster).

ðŸš€ **Build on This** â†’ Now that youâ€™ve successfully deployed and interacted with a Gasless Paymaster,
consider extending its logic to include **custom validation rules, user whitelisting, or sponsorship models** for transactions!
