title: L1 governance contract
description: Build and deploy a smart contract in L1 and send transactions that update the state of a contract in ZKsync.
---

This tutorial shows you how to implement communication between L1 and L2 with the following example:

- A **Governance** Solidity smart contract is deployed on layer 1. This contract has a function that sends a transaction
  to ZKsync Era layer 2.
- A **Counter** Solidity smart contract is deployed on ZKsync Era layer 2. This contract stores a number that is incremented

  by calling the `increment` method. The `Governance` contract on layer 1 calls this function.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure your machine satisfies the [system
  requirements](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/tree/main#system-requirements).
- You are already familiar with deploying smart contracts on ZKsync Era.
  If not, please refer to the first section of the [quickstart tutorial](https://docs.zksync.io/build/start-coding/quick-start).
- You already have some experience working with Ethereum.
- A wallet with sufficient Sepolia `%%zk_testnet_currency_symbol%%` on Ethereum and %%zk_testnet_name%% to pay for deploying smart
  contracts. You can get Sepolia ETH from the [network faucets](https://docs.zksync.io/ecosystem/network-faucets).
  - Get testnet `ETH` for ZKsync Era using [bridges](https://zksync.io/explore#bridges) to bridge funds to ZKsync.
- You know how to get your [private key from your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

### Complete Project

Download the [complete project on GitHub](https://github.com/matter-labs/tutorials/tree/main/cross-chain).

## Project Setup

Open a terminal window, create a new folder for the project tutorial, e.g. `mkdir cross-chain-tutorial`, and `cd` into
the folder.

Now create separate folders to store contracts and scripts on L1 and L2. For now we will start with L1-governance
folder.

```sh
mkdir L1-governance
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-circle"}
The `L1-governance` code is a default Hardhat project used to deploy a contract on L1.
The `L2-counter` code includes all ZKsync dependencies and configurations for L2.
::

## L1 Governance

1. `cd` into `L1-governance`.

2. Run the following to initialise and set up the L1 project:

```sh
npx hardhat init
```

Select the option **Create a Typescript project** and accept the defaults for everything else.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-circle"}
To interact with the ZKsync bridge contract using Solidity, you need
the ZKsync contract interface. There are two ways to get it:

- Import it from the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package (preferred).
- Download it from the [contracts repo](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts).

::

1. Install the following dependencies:

Make sure you use actual node (lts version) and actual npm version

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat typechain ethers dotenv
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat typechain ethers dotenv
```

::

### Create L1 Governance Contract

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
Make sure you're still in the `L1-governance` folder.
::

The following Solidity code defines the Governance smart contract.

The constructor sets the contract creator as the single governor.
The `callZkSync` function calls a transaction on L2 which can only be called by the governor.

1. Remove existing `/test` directory and any contracts that exist in `/contracts`.

2. `cd` into the `contracts/` folder.

3. Create a file called `Governance.sol` and copy/paste the code below into it.

```solidity [Governance.sol]
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l1/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IZkSync.sol";

contract Governance {
    address public governor;

    constructor() {
        governor = msg.sender;
    }

    function callZkSync(
        address zkSyncAddress,
        address contractAddr,
        bytes memory data,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        uint256 gasPerPubdataByteLimit
    ) external payable {
        require(msg.sender == governor, "Only governor is allowed");

        IZkSync zksync = IZkSync(zkSyncAddress);
        zksync.requestL2Transaction{value: msg.value}(contractAddr, 0,
            data, gasLimit, gasPerPubdataByteLimit, new bytes[](0), msg.sender);
    }
}
```

### Deploy L1 Governance Contract

1. Create the file `L1-Governance/.env` and copy/paste the code below, filling in the relevant values.
  Find node provider urls [here](https://chainlist.org/chain/11155111).
  You have to connect your wallet to the network and add the network to the wallet in advance.

    ```txt [L1-Governance/.env]
    NODE_RPC_URL=
    PRIVATE_KEY=
    ```

1. Replace the code in `hardhat.config.ts` with the following:

    ```ts
    import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
    import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

    import dotenv from "dotenv";
    dotenv.config();

    const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
      solidity: "0.8.24",
      networks: {
            // Sepolia network
            sepolia: {
              url: process.env.NODE_RPC_URL,
              accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as any],
            },
          },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

1. Create the file `Governance.ts` inside the `/ignition/modules` folder and copy/paste the following code into it:

    ```ts
    import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

    const GovernanceModule = buildModule("GovernanceModule", (m) => {
      
      const governance = m.contract("Governance", [], {  });

      return { governance };
    });

    export default GovernanceModule;

    ```

1. From the `L1-governance` folder root, compile and deploy the contract:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    # compile contract
    npx hardhat compile

    # deploy contract
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    # compile contract
    yarn hardhat compile

    # deploy contract
    yarn hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia
    ```

    ::

    You should see the following output:

    ```sh
    Deploying [ GovernanceModule ]
    Batch #1
      Executed GovernanceModule#Governance

    [ GovernanceModule ] successfully deployed ðŸš€

    Deployed Addresses

    GovernanceModule#Governance - 0xA7d27A1202bE1237919Cf2cb60970141100725b4
    ```

    Save the address to use in a later step.
