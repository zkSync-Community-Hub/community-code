title: Frontend Quickstart, build your first dApp
description: Build a frontend that allows users to interact smart contracts paying fees with ERC20 tokens on ZKsync.
---

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
Although this tutorial can be used as a reference
to understand how to create frontends to interact with smart contracts deployed to ZKsync,
it requires a smart contract already deployed.
::

In this tutorial we're going to:

- Create a basic frontend to interact with a smart contract deployed in ZKsync.
- Learn about `zksync-ethers` and use it to connect to ZKsync and interact with our contract.
- Learn about paymasters.
- Integrate a paymaster in our frontend to allow users to pay transaction fees in any ERC20 token.

## Prerequisites

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
- Use the `yarn` or `npm` package manager. We recommend using `yarn`.
  To install `yarn`, follow the [Yarn installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
- Get some ERC20 tokens.
  The easiest way is to [mint TEST tokens](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/address/0x7E2026D8f35872923F5459BbEDDB809F6aCEfEB3#contract)
  directly in our explorer.
  You can also get Sepolia USDC or DAI from [the Aave faucet](https://staging.aave.com/faucet/)
  and then bridge them to ZKsync using [the ZKsync bridge](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/?network=sepolia).
- Complete [the ZKsync 101 tutorials](https://docs.zksync.io/build/start-coding/zksync-101) to deploy a smart contract.

## Setting Up the Project

We're going use the [Vue.js web framework](https://vuejs.org/) to build this app although
the process is similar with other frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/).
In addition, we're going to use the `zksync-ethers` SDK, which extends `ethers` with ZKsync-specific features.

First, create a new project folder called `frontend-paymaster`.

:test-action{actionId="make-project-folder"}

```bash
mkdir frontend-paymaster
cd frontend-paymaster
```

### Deploying the Greeter Contract

Next, let's deploy a simple `Greeter` contract that we can
use for testing.
Make a new `contracts` folder using the `zksync-cli` command below:

:test-action{actionId="make-contracts-folder"}

```bash
npx zksync-cli create contracts --template hardhat_solidity
```

Enter the private key you will use for deployment when prompted.

Then, move into the `contracts` folder and compile the template contracts.

:test-action{actionId="wait-for-init"}
:test-action{actionId="compile-contracts"}

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run compile
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn compile
```

::

Finally, deploy the `Greeter` contract by running the template deploy script.
Make sure to save the deployed contract address for the next section.

:test-action{actionId="update-hh-config"}
:test-action{actionId="env-pk"}
:test-action{actionId="deploy-greeter"}

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run deploy
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn deploy
```

::

### Setting Up the Frontend

Move out of the `contracts` folder and back into main project folder, and create a new `frontend` project with Vue.

:test-action{actionId="make-frontend"}

```bash
npm create vue@latest --project-name frontend -- --typescript
```

Then, move into the `frontend` folder and install the project dependencies below.

:test-action{actionId="install-frontend-deps"}

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install ethers zksync-ethers
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add ethers zksync-ethers
```

::

Next, replace the code in `src/App.vue` with the template code below:

:test-action{actionId="wait-for-install"}
:test-action{actionId="open-panel"}
:test-action{actionId="app-template-code"}

::drop-panel

::panel{label="App.vue"}

```javascript [src/App.vue]
:code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/template-code/App.vue",remove-linter}
```

::
::

## Project Structure

We'll only work in the `<script>` section of the `./src/App.vue` file.
Some methods are already provided while other have to be implemented.
We'll go through these ones one by one:

```javascript [src/App.vue]
:code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/template-code/App.vue:methods-to-be-implemented",remove-linter}
```

## Add the Contract Info

:test-action{actionId="contract-env-var"}

Update the `.env` file in the `frontend` folder to add the `VITE_GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable
with the deployed contract address from the previous section.

```env
VITE_GREETER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<0x_YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

## Initialise Provider and Signer

The `initializeProviderAndSigner` function in `./src/App.vue` is called right after the connection to Metamask is successful.
In this function we should:

- Initialize a `BrowserProvider` and a `Signer` to interact with ZKsync.
- Initialize the `Contract` object to interact with the `Greeter` contract we deployed previously.

1. Import the necessary classes from `zksync-ethers` in the import statement we added previously:

    :test-action{actionId="add-zksync-imports"}

    ```javascript  [src/App.vue]
    :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:zksync-ethers-imports",remove-linter}
    ```

1. Initialise the provider, signer, and contract instances like this:

    :test-action{actionId="initialize-provider-and-signer"}

    ```javascript [src/App.vue]
     :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:initialize-provider-and-signer",remove-linter}
    ```

    :test-action{actionId="change-provider-to-local"}

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
`zksync-ethers` extends the existing classes from `ethers` with zksync-specific methods so,
unless you're using any of those features, you won't need to do any changes in your code.
Note that classes like `Contract` and `Provider` have the same constructor parameters.
::

## Retrieve the Greeting

Fill in the function to retrieve the greeting from the smart contract:

:test-action{actionId="get-greeting"}

```javascript  [src/App.vue]
:code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:get-greeting",remove-linter}
```

Now, after connecting the Metamask wallet to %%zk_testnet_name%%, you will see the following page:

!['Retrieve message from contract'](/images/frontend-paymaster/quickstart-hello-nofee.jpeg)

The "select token" dropdown menu allows you to choose which token to pay fees with.
We'll enable this feature later.

## Check Balance and Estimate Fee

The easiest way to retrieve the user's balance is to use the `Signer.getBalance` function.

1. Add the following dependencies to the same place you added imports before:

    :test-action{actionId="add-ethers-imports"}

    ```javascript
    :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:ethers-imports",remove-linter}
    ```

1. Implement the `getFee()` method that will estimate how much will it cost
  to update the message in the `Greeter.sol` contract calling the `setGreeting` method:

    :test-action{actionId="get-fee"}

    ```javascript
     :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:get-fee",remove-linter}
    ```

1. Implement the `getBalance()` function as shown below:

    :test-action{actionId="get-balance"}

    ```javascript
    :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:get-balance",remove-linter}
    ```

Now, when you select the token to pay the fee, both the account balance and the expected fee for the transaction will be displayed.

You can enter the message you want to save and click **Refresh** to recalculate the fee.
Note that the fee depends on the length of the message that we want to store in the contract.

![Estimate transaction fee](/images/frontend-paymaster/quickstart-hello.jpeg)

It is possible to also click on the **Change greeting** button, but nothing will happen yet as we haven't implemented the function.
Let's implement that next.

## Update the Greeting

Update the `changeGreeting` function in `./src/App.vue` with the following code:

:test-action{actionId="change-greeting"}

```javascript [src/App.vue]
:code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:change-greeting",remove-linter}
```

Now you can update the greeting message in the contract via a transaction sent with Metamask.
Once the transaction is processed, you will see the Greeter message change on the app.

Congrats! You now have a fully functional Greeter-dApp!
However, it does not yet leverage any ZKsync-specific features.
Let's fix that by integrating a paymaster!

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
Do you see a **wallet_requestPermissions** error?
<br />
Refresh your browser, or open the Metamask extension on your browser and click _Next_ or _Cancel_ to resolve it.
<br />
Read more about `wallet_requestPermissions`, in the [MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/rpc-api.html#wallet-requestpermissions).

## Pay Fees with ERC20 Tokens

ZKsync Era has native account abstraction, a feature that allows application developers to integrate paymasters.
You can find more information about paymasters in [this section of our docs](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction/paymasters)
but the TL;DR is the following:

- Paymasters are smart contracts that alter the fee mechanism of the protocol.
- The paymaster contract pays the transaction fees with ETH using its own balance.
- Instead of forcing users to just pay transaction fees with ETH, the paymaster contract logic dictates what can be done.
- From a user's point of view, paymasters can allow users to pay gas fess with ERC20 tokens or even allow gasless transactions.
- To integrate a paymaster in your app, transactions must include specific parameters as transaction overrides in a custom property called `paymasterParams`.

We will use the [testnet paymaster](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction/paymasters#testnet-paymaster)
that is provided on all ZKsync Era testnets.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
**The testnet paymaster allows users to pay fees in any ERC20 token with a fixed exchange rate of 1:1 - Token:ETH**,
i.e. one unit of the token for one wei of ETH.
</br>
This means that transaction fees in tokens with fewer decimals than ETH will be bigger;
for example, USDC which has only 6 decimals.
This is a known behaviour of the testnet paymaster, which was built for demonstration purposes only.
</br>
As the name suggests, the testnet paymaster is only available on testnet.
When integrating your protocol on mainnet, you should follow the documentation of the paymaster you use, or create your own.

::

The `getOverrides` function returns an empty object when users decide to pay with Ether but,
when users select the ERC20 option, it should return the paymaster address and all the information required to interact with it.
Let's see how it's done.

1. The first step to allow payments with ERC20 tokens is to add them to the dropdown selector. Right now the dropdown selector only shows ETH.
To add more options, uncomment some of the tokens within the `allowedTokens` variable or add your own.

1. To retrieve the address of the testnet paymaster we'll use the `getTestnetPaymasterAddress` method from the ZKsync provider.
  This is one of the zksync-specific methods provided by `zksync-ethers`:

    ```javascript
    :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/template-code/App.vue:get-overrides",remove-linter}
    ```

<!-- 1. Import `utils` from `zksync-ethers` SDK as we'll need to use some of its methods next:

    ```javascript
    import { Contract, BrowserProvider, Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
    ``` -->

1. We need to calculate how many tokens are required to process the transaction.
  Since the testnet paymaster exchanges any ERC20 token to ETH at a 1:1 rate, the amount is the same as the ETH amount in wei:

    ```javascript
    :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:get-overrides-first-part",remove-linter}
    ```

1. Now, what is left is to encode the `paymasterInput` following the
  [protocol requirements](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction/paymasters#testnet-paymaster)
  and return the needed overrides.

    This will be the complete function:

    :test-action{actionId="get-overrides-full"}

    ```javascript
    :code-import{filePath="frontend-paymaster/frontend/src/App.vue:get-overrides",remove-linter}
    ```

    The `ApprovalBased` type in the `paymasterParams` indicates that this paymaster allows ERC20 tokens.
    Behind the scenes, ZKsync Era will take care of approving the ERC20 spending.

## Complete Application

Now you should be able to update the greeting message with ETH or any of the available tokens.

1. To test out the application, start the development server, and navigate to [`http://localhost:5173/`](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

    :test-action{actionId="run-project"}

    ::code-group

    ```bash [npm]
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn dev
    ```

    ::

    :test-action{actionId="use-local-chain"}
    :test-action{actionId="go-to-app"}

1. Select one of the ERC20 tokens to see the estimated fee:

    ![img](/images/frontend-paymaster/quickstart-dai-fees.jpeg)

1. Click on the `Change greeting` button to update the message.
  Since the `paymasterParams` were supplied, the transaction will be an `EIP712` ([more on EIP712 here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712))
  so it will look slightly different in your wallet:

    ![img](/images/frontend-paymaster/start-4.png)

1. Click "Sign" to send the transaction.

    After the transaction is processed, the page updates the balances and the new greeting can be viewed.

**You've paid for this transaction with an ERC20 token using the testnet paymaster** 🎉

## Takeaways

- `zksync-ethers` is a Javascript library that extends `ethers` with ZKsync-specific methods.
- Paymasters allow users to pay transaction fees in ERC20 tokens or gasless.
- Paymasters can be easily integrated in frontend applications by including additional transaction parameters.
