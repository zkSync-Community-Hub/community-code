title: Cross Chain Tutorial L2 Counter Part 1
---

## L2 Counter

Now that we have an address for the L1 governance contract, we can build, deploy, and test the counter contract on L2.

1. `cd` out of `L1-governance` and initialize the `L2-counter` project:

    ```sh
    npx zksync-cli create L2-counter --template hardhat_solidity
    ```

1. Use the same private key for the `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` variable in the `.env` file.

1. For the purposes of this tutorial, we don't need the example smart contracts and deployment script files generated by `zksync-cli`.
   Run the following commands to remove them:

    ```sh
    cd L2-counter
    rm -rf ./contracts/*
    rm -rf ./scripts/*
    ```

### Create L2 Counter Contract

1. In the `L2-counter/contracts/` directory, create a new file `Counter.sol`.

    ```sh
    touch contracts/Counter.sol
    ```

    This contract contains the address of the governance contract deployed previously on layer 1, and an incrementable
  counter which can only be invoked by the governance contract.

1. Copy/paste the following code into the file:

    ```solidity [Counter.sol]
    :code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L2-counter/contracts/Counter.sol"}
    ```

1. Compile the contract from the `L2-counter` root:

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    Compilations happens only after the installation of a compiler.
