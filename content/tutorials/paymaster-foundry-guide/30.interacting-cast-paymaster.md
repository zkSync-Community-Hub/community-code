title: Interacting with the Gasless Paymaster
description: Learn how to interact with paymasters using `cast` and `forge create`.

### **Interacting with the Gasless Paymaster**  

Now that we have successfully deployed and validated the **Gasless Paymaster**, the next step is to demonstrate
how **users can interact with it** to execute transactions **without paying gas fees** using `cast send` and `forge create`.  

## **Sending a Gasless Transaction with `cast send`**  

The `cast send` command allows us to **sign and broadcast transactions**, when used alongside ZKsync paymaster flags we can
cover gas fees by the paymaster instead of the sender.

### **Required Flags**  

To execute a transaction using a paymaster, we need to specify:  

- **`--zk-paymaster-address`** â†’ The address of the deployed paymaster contract.  
- **`--zk-paymaster-input`** â†’ The encoded input required for the paymaster contract to process the transaction.  

### **Encoding the Paymaster Input**  

To properly encode the paymaster input, we use the `cast calldata` command:  

```sh
cast calldata "general(bytes)" "0x"
```

### **Executing a Transaction with the GaslessPaymaster**  

Let's say we want to call the `increment()` function on our deployed `Counter` contract **without paying gas fees**:  

```sh
cast send 0xb3EA1C4F4f0cF65767f0c870E63523c321e92003 "increment()" \
  --rpc-url anvil-zksync \
  --interactive 1 \
  --zk-paymaster-address 0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF \
  --zk-paymaster-input $(cast calldata "general(bytes)" "0x")
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to enter a private key. Select one from the list displayed when launching `anvil-zksync`:  

```bash
Enter private key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

### **What This Command Does**  
âœ… Calls the `increment()` function on the `Counter` contract.  
âœ… Specifies `anvil-zksync` as the RPC endpoint.  
âœ… Uses the deployed **Gasless Paymaster** (`0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF`) to cover the gas fees.  
âœ… Passes the encoded **paymaster input** for processing the transaction.  

Once executed, the **Counter contract's `increment()` function** should be successfully invoked without requiring the sender to pay gas fees.

## **Deploying a Contract with the Paymaster Using `forge create`**  

In addition to sending transactions, we can also deploy new smart contracts **while using a paymaster to cover gas costs**
in a single command using `forge create`.

### **Required Flags**  

Similar to `cast send`, the `forge create` command requires:  

- **`--zk-paymaster-address`** â†’ The address of the deployed paymaster contract.  
- **`--zk-paymaster-input`** â†’ The encoded input for the paymaster.  

### **Deploying a Contract Using the Paymaster**  

To deploy a new `Counter` contract **without spending gas** from our own wallet, run:  

```sh
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --rpc-url anvil-zksync \
  --interactive \
  --zksync \
  --zk-paymaster-address 0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF  \
  --zk-paymaster-input $(cast calldata "general(bytes)" "0x")
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to enter a private key. Select one from the list displayed when launching `anvil-zksync`:  

```bash
Enter private key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

### **What This Command Does**  
âœ… Deploys a new `Counter` contract on ZKsync.  
âœ… Uses the **Gasless Paymaster** to cover the gas fees.  
âœ… Ensures the deployment is processed on a **ZKsync-compatible environment** (`--zksync`).  

Upon successful execution, the **Counter contract will be deployed with gas fees covered by the paymaster**.

## **Next Steps**  

ðŸŽ¯ **Verify Balance Changes** â†’ After sending transactions and deploying contracts, check the paymaster's balance to confirm it covered the fees:  

```sh
cast balance 0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF --rpc-url anvil-zksync | cast from-wei
```

ðŸ“– **Explore the ZKsync Paymaster Documentation** â†’ Learn more about paymaster configurations and advanced usage in the
[ZKsync Paymaster Docs](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/unique-features/paymaster).

ðŸš€ **Build on This** â†’ Now that youâ€™ve successfully deployed and interacted with a Gasless Paymaster,
consider extending its logic to include **custom validation rules, user whitelisting, or sponsorship models** for transactions!
