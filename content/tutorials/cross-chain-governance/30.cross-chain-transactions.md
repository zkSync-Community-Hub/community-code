## Call L2 Contract from L1

Now, let's call the `increment` method on Layer 2 from Layer 1.

1. Copy the `abi` array from the compilation artifact located at:

    `/L1-governance/artifacts/contracts/Governance.sol/Governance.json`.

    You have to copy only abi content from the file after the keyword abi, an example below:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "inputs": [
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "newGovernance",
            "type": "address"
          }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "constructor"
      },
      {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "governance",
        "outputs": [
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "",
            "type": "address"
          }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
      },
      {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "increment",
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "function"
      },
      {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "value",
        "outputs": [
          {
            "internalType": "uint256",
            "name": "",
            "type": "uint256"
          }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Paste it into a new file: `/L2-counter/scripts/governance.json`.

1. Create the `L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts` file and paste in the following code, replacing the following
   details:

    - GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L1.
    - COUNTER-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L2.
    - RPC-URL: the same url you used in the `.env` file of the `L1-governance` folder.

    ```ts [L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts]
    import { Contract, Wallet, Interface } from "ethers";
    import { Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
    // load env file
    import dotenv from "dotenv";
    dotenv.config();

    const GOVERNANCE_ABI = require("./governance.json");
    const GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS = "<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>";
    const COUNTER_ABI = require("./counter.json");
    const COUNTER_ADDRESS = "<COUNTER-ADDRESS>";

    const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY || "";
    if (!PRIVATE_KEY) throw "⛔️ Private key not detected! Add it to the .env file!";
    // Initialize the wallet.

    async function main() {
      // Enter your Ethereum L1 provider RPC URL.
      const l1Provider = new Provider("<L1-RPC-URL>");
      // Set up the Governor wallet to be the same as the one that deployed the governance contract.
      const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, l1Provider);
      // Set a constant that accesses the Layer 1 contract.
      const govcontract = new Contract(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS, GOVERNANCE_ABI, wallet);

      // Initialize the L2 provider.
      const l2Provider = new Provider("https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev");
      // Get the current address of the ZKsync L1 bridge.
      const zkSyncAddress = await l2Provider.getMainContractAddress();
      // Get the `Contract` object of the ZKsync bridge.
      const zkSyncContract = new Contract(zkSyncAddress, utils.ZKSYNC_MAIN_ABI, wallet);

      // Encoding the L1 transaction is done in the same way as it is done on Ethereum.
      // Use an Interface which gives access to the contract functions.
      const counterInterface = new Interface(COUNTER_ABI);
      const data = counterInterface.encodeFunctionData("increment", []);

      // The price of an L1 transaction depends on the gas price used.
      // You should explicitly fetch the gas price before making the call.
      const gasPrice = await l1Provider.getGasPrice();

      // Define a constant for gas limit which estimates the limit for the L1 to L2 transaction.
      const gasLimit = await l2Provider.estimateL1ToL2Execute({
        contractAddress: COUNTER_ADDRESS,
        calldata: data,
        caller: utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS),
      });
      // baseCost takes the price and limit and formats the total in wei.
      // For more information on `REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT` see the [fee model documentation](../developer-guides/transactions/fee-model.md).
      const baseCost = await zkSyncContract.l2TransactionBaseCost(gasPrice, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT);

      // !! If you don't include the gasPrice and baseCost in the transaction, a re-estimation of fee may generate errors.
      const tx = await govcontract.callZkSync(zkSyncAddress, COUNTER_ADDRESS, data, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT, {
        // Pass the necessary ETH `value` to cover the fee for the operation
        value: baseCost,
        gasPrice,
      });

      // Wait until the L1 tx is complete.
      await tx.wait();

      // Get the TransactionResponse object for the L2 transaction corresponding to the execution call.
      const l2Response = await l2Provider.getL2TransactionFromPriorityOp(tx);

      // Output the receipt of the L2 transaction corresponding to the call to the counter contract.
      const l2Receipt = await l2Response.wait();
      console.log(l2Receipt);
    }

    // We recommend always using this async/await pattern to properly handle errors.
    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exitCode = 1;
    });
    ```

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    Executing transactions from L1 requires the caller to pay a fee to the L2 operator.
    The fee depends on the length of the calldata and the `gasLimit`.
    This is similar to the `gasLimit` on Ethereum.

    You can read more about the [ZKsync fee model here](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/fee-model).
    The fee also depends on the gas price that is used during the transaction call.
    So to have a predictable fee for the call, the gas price should be fetched from the L1 provider.
    ::

1. Run the script with the following command:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ::

    In the output, you should see the full transaction receipt in L2.
    You can take the `transactionHash` and track it in the [ZKsync explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).
    It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      to: '0x9b379893bfAD08c12C2167C3e3dBf591BeD9410a',
      from: '0xE2EA97507a6cb610c81c4A9c157B8060E2ED7036',
      contractAddress: null,
      transactionIndex: 0,
      root: '0xb9ca78c288163a322a797ee671db8e9ab430eb00e38c4a989f2246ea22493945',
      gasUsed: BigNumber { _hex: '0x05c3df', _isBigNumber: true },
      logsBloom: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
      blockHash: '0xb9ca78c288163a322a797ee671db8e9ab430eb00e38c4a989f2246ea22493945',
      transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',
      logs: [
        {
          transactionIndex: 0,
          blockNumber: 4119331,
          transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',
          address: '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000800A',
          topics: [Array],
          ...

    ```

1. Verify that the transaction was successful by running the `display-value` script again.

    ```sh
    npx ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    You should see an incremented value in the output:

    ```txt
    The counter value is 1
    ```
