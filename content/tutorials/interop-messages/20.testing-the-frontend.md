title: Testing the frontend
description: Test running the frontend for the interop DeFi app.
---

The frontend has most of what we need to run it, but is just missing a few details.
Let's add them!

## Constants

Move into the frontend folder and create a new file in the `src/config` folder called `constants.ts`:

```bash
cd frontend
touch src/config/constants.ts
```

Copy and paste the code below:

```ts [src/config/constants.ts]
:code-import{filePath="interop-messages/frontend/config/constants.ts"}
```

Update the contract addresses with your deployed contract addresses.

## Wagmi config

In the `src/config/wagmi.ts` file, double check that the RPC endpoints and chain IDs for match your local chains.

## Interop utils

Finally, create a new folder called `utils` in the `src` folder.

```bash
mkdir src/utils
```

Then create a file called `prove.ts` in that folder:

```bash
touch src/utils/prove.ts
```

Copy and paste the functions below:

```ts [src/utils/prove.ts]
:code-import{filePath="interop-messages/frontend/utils/prove.ts"}
```

## Handling Verification

In `components/MintForm.tsx` update the `handleSubmit` function with the completed function below:

```ts [src/components/MintForm.tsx]
:code-import{filePath="interop-messages/frontend/components/MintForm.tsx:submit"}
```

## Run the app

Use the command below to run the frontend.

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [bun]
bun dev
```

::

You can now open the frontend at [`http://localhost:5173/`](http://localhost:5173/).

On the frontend, you should be able to add each network to your wallet by clicking on them.

You can send funds to your wallet using the `zkstack dev rich-account` command:

```bash
zkstack dev rich-account --chain zk_chain_1 0x<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

```bash
zkstack dev rich-account --chain zk_chain_2 0x<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

```bash
zkstack dev rich-account --chain zk_chain_3 0x<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

Now you can test the staking and tokens contracts with the frontend.
On a staking chain, deposit some amount and then copy your transaction hash.
On the rewards chain, input the transaction hash and select the staking chain you used.
Then click the mint button to mint a token.
