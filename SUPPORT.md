# Support

Are you in need of help getting started or having trouble with a project?
We have multiple channels available for you to request help.

## Where to get help

If you are in need of help with submitting your guide to the Community Code,
first read through the [Contributing doc](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see if it may help answer some questions.
If the answer is not found, submit an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/ZKsync-Community-Hub/community-code/issues).

We also have resources available on the [zksync-developers Discussions](https://github.com/ZKsync-Community-Hub/zksync-developers/discussions)
where you can submit a question. We also have a [Discord community](https://join.zksync.dev/)
that may help with any troubleshooting, check out the `ðŸ–¥â”‚dev-general` channel.

If you have questions related to any of our ZKsync tools,
we recommend that you submit an Issue related to that project.
You can find the list of our open-source repositories in the
[Contribution Track](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/contribution-track)
on our ZKsync Docs site.

## ðŸª² Submit a bug report for a guide

Are you going through a guide in our Code Community and came across a bug?
Perhaps the versions are out of date or a particular tool is broken when trying to run a project.
Submit an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/ZKsync-Community-Hub/community-code/issues) using our Issue form
or submit it directly from the Guide you're working from! In the left sidebar on the site, there is a link at the bottom
for "Submit an issue" which will set up a pre-filled Issue form for the particular guide you're on.
