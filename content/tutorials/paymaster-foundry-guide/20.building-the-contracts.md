title: Building and Deploying a Gasless Paymaster  
description: Learn how to build, and deploy, a Gasless Paymaster on ZKsync using Foundry-ZKsync.  

---

### **Setting Up Your Project**  

In this guide, we will set up a **Foundry-ZKsync project** that integrates a **Gasless Paymaster**. By the end of this
section, you will have a structured development environment ready for **contract development, testing, and deployment** on ZKsync.  

## **Project Initialization**  

To get started, **clone the template repository** into a new project folder called `zk-paymaster`:  

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dutterbutter/paymaster-foundry-guide.git zk-paymaster
```

This template includes the **basic Foundry setup** needed to begin development. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find inside:  

- **`src/`** â€“ Contains the `Counter` contract, which we will use in our paymaster demonstration.  
- **`script/`** â€“ Contains scripts for deploying contracts. We will update this to include our deployment script for the Gasless Paymaster.  
- **`test/`** â€“ Includes a Foundry-style test suite for the `Counter` contract.  

### **Whatâ€™s Missing?**  

The template does not yet include:  

âœ… The **Gasless Paymaster** contract  
âœ… A **deployment script** that utilizes ZKsync's paymaster features and cheatcodes

Weâ€™ll add these components next.  

## **Installing Dependencies**  

To implement a Gasless Paymaster, we need a few key dependencies:  

- **`@zksync-contracts`** â€“ Provides interfaces for interacting with ZKsync-specific smart contracts, including the paymaster system.  
- **`@openzeppelin-contracts`** â€“ Contains reusable smart contract utilities, including `Ownable`, which we will use for access control.  
- **`forge-zksync-std`** â€“ Extends Foundry with ZKsync-specific utilities, including cheatcodes for testing and debugging.  

### **Installing Dependencies with Soldeer**  

For dependency management, we will use [Soldeer](https://soldeer.xyz/), a **dedicated Solidity package manager**. If you
prefer, you can install dependencies via Git submodules using `forge install matter-labs/v2-testnet-contracts@beta`.

However, for this guide, we will use **Soldeer** to install our required packages:

```sh
cd zk-paymaster
forge soldeer install @zksync-contracts~0.0.1
forge soldeer install @openzeppelin-contracts~5.2.0
forge soldeer install forge-zksync-std~0.0.1
```

### **What This Command Does:**  

- Creates a `dependencies/` folder to store the installed packages.  
- Installs `@zksync-contracts`, `@openzeppelin-contracts`, and `forge-zksync-std`.  
- Generates a `remappings.txt` file for clean import paths, simplifying contract development.  

With our project set up and dependencies installed, we are now ready to **write and deploy our Gasless Paymaster contract**! ðŸš€

### GaslessPaymaster Contract Code

Next, create a new file for our paymaster contract called `GaslessPaymaster.sol`.

```sh
touch src/GaslessPaymaster.sol
```

Copy and paste the full contract below into the file.

::drop-panel
::panel{label="GaslessPaymaster.sol"}

```solidity [src/GaslessPaymaster.sol]
:code-import{filePath="zk-paymaster/src/GaslessPaymaster.sol"}
```

### Understanding the `GaslessPaymaster` Contract  

Let's break down the `GaslessPaymaster` contract and explain how it works.  

### **Contract Overview**  

This `GaslessPaymaster` contract implements the `IPaymaster` interface from ZKsync and follows the
**General Paymaster Flow**. Its primary role is to cover gas fees for transactions, making them gasless for users.  

Unlike more complex paymaster implementations that apply additional validation logic, this contract
**accepts all transactions by default** as long as they follow the required format.  

## **Key Components**  

### **Constructor Function**  

```solidity
constructor(address initialOwner) Ownable(initialOwner) {}
```  

- This initializes the contract and sets the `initialOwner` who has administrative privileges.  
- The `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin provides **ownership management**, allowing only the owner to withdraw funds from the paymaster.  

### **Modifiers**  

#### `onlyBootloader`  

```solidity
modifier onlyBootloader() {
    require(
        msg.sender == BOOTLOADER_FORMAL_ADDRESS,
        "Only bootloader can call this method"
    );
    _;
}
```  

- Ensures that only the ZKsync **bootloader** (a system contract responsible for transaction execution) can call certain functions.  

### **Functions**  

#### `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction`  

```solidity
function validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction(
    bytes32,
    bytes32,
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) 
    external 
    payable 
    onlyBootloader 
    returns (bytes4 magic, bytes memory context)
```

This function is the core of the paymaster's logic. It **validates transactions** and **pays gas fees** if they follow the General Paymaster Flow.

**How it works:**  

1. **Ensures Paymaster Input Format**  

   ```solidity
   require(
       _transaction.paymasterInput.length >= 4,
       "The standard paymaster input must be at least 4 bytes long"
   );
   ```

   - Ensures the transactionâ€™s paymaster input is valid by checking its length.  

2. **Checks for General Paymaster Flow**

   ```solidity
   bytes4 paymasterInputSelector = bytes4(_transaction.paymasterInput[0:4]);
   if (paymasterInputSelector == IPaymasterFlow.general.selector) {
   ```

   - Extracts the **selector** (first 4 bytes of `paymasterInput`) to verify it follows the **General Paymaster Flow**.  

3. **Calculates the Required ETH for Gas Fees**  

   ```solidity
   uint256 requiredETH = _transaction.gasLimit * _transaction.maxFeePerGas;
   ```

   - Computes the **exact gas fee** that the paymaster must pay to execute the transaction.  

4. **Transfers the ETH to the Bootloader**

   ```solidity
   (bool success, ) = payable(BOOTLOADER_FORMAL_ADDRESS).call{ value: requiredETH }("");
   require(success, "Failed to transfer tx fee to the Bootloader.");
   ```

   - The paymaster transfers the required gas fee directly to the ZKsync **bootloader**, covering the transactionâ€™s cost and execute the transaction.
   - If the paymaster does not have enough funds, the transaction **fails**.  

5. **Rejects Unsupported Paymaster Flows**

   ```solidity
   else {
       revert("Unsupported paymaster flow in paymasterParams.");
   }
   ```

   - If the transaction doesnâ€™t follow the General Paymaster Flow, it is **rejected**.  

### **Post-Transaction Processing**  

```solidity
function postTransaction(
    bytes calldata _context,
    Transaction calldata _transaction,
    bytes32,
    bytes32,
    ExecutionResult _txResult,
    uint256 _maxRefundedGas
) external payable override onlyBootloader {}
```

- This function is required by the `IPaymaster` interface but is left **empty** in this implementation.  
- It is usually used to perform **post-transaction validation** or **refund unused gas** in more advanced paymaster contracts.  

### **Fund Management Functions**  

#### `withdraw`  

```solidity
function withdraw(address payable _to) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: balance}("");
    require(success, "Failed to withdraw funds from paymaster.");
}
```

- Allows the **owner** to withdraw all funds from the contract.  
- Ensures that only the **contract owner** (not users or other contracts) can manage the paymasterâ€™s balance.  

#### `receive`  

```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```

- Allows the contract to receive **ETH deposits**, which are necessary to fund transactions.  
- This is critical because the paymaster needs ETH to cover users' gas fees.

## Deploying Contracts

Create a new file in the `script` directory:

```bash
touch script/GaslessPaymaster.s.sol
```

Copy and paste the deploy script:

```solidity [script/GaslessPaymaster.s.sol]
:code-import{filePath="zk-paymaster/script/GaslessPaymaster.s.sol"}
```

### Understanding the `GaslessPaymaster.s.sol` Deployment Script

This script deploys a **Gasless Paymaster** and a **Counter contract**, showcasing how to use the **ZKsync paymaster mechanism** with Foundry-ZKsync.
It also demonstrates how to interact with ZKsync-specific cheatcodes through `forge-zksync-std`.  

## **Key Components**  

### **Variables**  

The script defines two key contract instances:  

- **`paymaster`** â€“ An instance of the `GaslessPaymaster` contract.  
- **`counter`** â€“ An instance of the `Counter` contract.  
- **`paymasterEncodedInput`** â€“ Stores the encoded input required for the **General Paymaster Flow**, which will be used for paymaster transactions.  

### **Inheritance and Cheatcode Access**  

```solidity
contract PaymasterScript is Script, ScriptExt
```

- **`Script`** â€“ The base class from `forge-std`, providing scripting utilities.  
- **`ScriptExt`** â€“ Extended scripting utilities from `forge-zksync-std`.  
- Through `ScriptExt`, we can access **ZKsync-specific cheatcodes** using `vmExt` (e.g., `vmExt.zkUsePaymaster`).  

### **The `run` Function**  

#### **Step 1: Start Transaction Broadcasting**  

```solidity
vm.startBroadcast();
```

- **`startBroadcast()`** allows the script to execute transactions as the sender (`msg.sender`).  
- This ensures that contract deployments and transactions are properly recorded.

### **Step 2: Deploy and Fund the Paymaster using CREATE2**  

#### **Using CREATE2 for Predictable Deployment Addresses**  

```solidity
paymaster = new GaslessPaymaster{salt: "1234"}(msg.sender);
```

- **Deploys the `GaslessPaymaster` contract using CREATE2**, which allows the contract address to be deterministically computed before deployment.
- The **`salt` parameter (`"1234"`)** ensures the deployment address remains consistent.
- **Passes `msg.sender` as the contract owner**, ensuring that the deployer retains administrative control through OpenZeppelinâ€™s `Ownable` contract.

#### **Funding the Paymaster**  

```solidity
(bool success,) = address(paymaster).call{value: 1 ether}("");
require(success, "Failed to fund Paymaster.");
```

- Transfers **1 ETH** to the paymaster contract, ensuring it has sufficient funds to cover gas fees for gasless transactions.
- If the transfer fails, the script **reverts**, preventing deployment from proceeding with an unfunded paymaster.

#### **Step 3: Encode the Paymaster Input**  

```solidity
paymasterEncodedInput = abi.encodeWithSelector(
    bytes4(keccak256("general(bytes)")),
    bytes("")
);
```

- Encodes the **General Paymaster Flow selector**, which is required when using a paymaster.  

#### **Step 4: Deploy the Counter Contract with the Paymaster Covering Fees**

#### **Using the `zkUsePaymaster` Cheatcode**  

Before deploying the `Counter` contract, we use the **`zkUsePaymaster`** cheatcode, which allows us
to specify a paymaster to cover the gas fees for the **next** transaction.  

```solidity
vmExt.zkUsePaymaster(address(paymaster), paymasterEncodedInput);
```

- **`vmExt.zkUsePaymaster(paymaster, paymasterEncodedInput);`**  
  - This instructs the Foundry-ZKsync environment to use the specified **paymaster contract** for the **next transaction**.  
  - The `paymasterEncodedInput` ensures that the transaction specifies the **General Paymaster Flow**, which allows the paymaster to cover the gas fees.

##### **Deploy the Counter Contract using CREATE2**  

```solidity
counter = new Counter{salt: "1234"}();
```

- **Deploys the `Counter` contract**, which will later be used for gasless transactions.

#### **Step 5: Stop Transaction Broadcasting**  

```solidity
vm.stopBroadcast();
```

- Ends the transaction broadcasting session.  

### **Deploying to a Local Anvil-ZKsync Instance**  

`anvil-zksync` is included with Foundry-ZKsync, providing an easy way to run a local ZKsync node.
This allows for fast and efficient contract deployment and testing without interacting with a live network.  

#### **Starting the Local Node**  

To start an `anvil-zksync` instance, run:  

```bash
anvil-zksync
```

This will launch a local ZKsync environment and display a list of pre-funded accounts:  

```bash
Rich Accounts
==================

(0) 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 (10000 ETH)
...

Private Keys
==================

(0) 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
...
```

These accounts can be used for deploying contracts and making transactions.  

### **Running the Deployment Script**  

With the local node running, open a new terminal window and execute the deployment script:  

```bash
forge script script/GaslessPaymaster.s.sol --zksync --slow --rpc-url anvil-zksync --broadcast --interactive 1
```

This script will:  

1. **Deploy the `GaslessPaymaster` contract using CREATE2**  
2. **Fund the paymaster with 1 ETH**  
3. **Deploy the `Counter` contract using the paymaster to cover gas fees**  

After running the script, you will be prompted to enter a private key. Select one from the list displayed when launching `anvil-zksync`:  

```bash
Enter private key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

### **Successful Script Execution Output**  

If the deployment is successful, you should see output similar to this:  

```bash
Script ran successfully.

This confirms that:  

- The **GaslessPaymaster was deployed**  
- The **Counter contract was deployed using the paymaster to cover gas fees**  

### **Verifying Paymaster Usage**  

To confirm that the paymaster was used to pay for the `Counter` contract deployment, we can inspect the `anvil-zksync` logs:  

```bash
âœ… [SUCCESS] Hash: 0x6051fd5de151f5f7226917062c0cd27ae8a0dfbb7b77990cd3af697bd88573a3

Refunded: 0.0001700868 ETH
```

Key observations:  

- The **first two transactions were paid for by the userâ€™s account** (`0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266`).  
- The **third transaction (Counter contract deployment) was paid by the GaslessPaymaster** (`0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF`).  

This confirms that the `zkUsePaymaster` cheatcode successfully instructed the paymaster to cover gas fees for the contract deployment.  

### **Checking Paymaster Balance After Deployment**  

Since the paymaster was initially funded with **1 ETH**, we expect the balance to have decreased
due to covering the deployment costs. We can check the balance using `cast`:  

```bash
cast balance 0xd9498989Fada9e78798F696B17Ab6B3b5Fe65FDF --rpc-url anvil-zksync | cast from-wei
```

Output:  

```bash
0.999919594867750000
```

This confirms that the paymaster's balance has **decreased** as expected, proving that it successfully covered the gas fees.  

---

### **Next Steps: Interacting with the Paymaster**  

Now that we have deployed and validated the GaslessPaymaster, the next step is to demonstrate
how **users can interact with it** to execute transactions **without paying gas fees** using `cast`. ðŸš€
