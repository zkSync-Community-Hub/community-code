## Prerequisites

- Make sure your machine satisfies the [system
  requirements](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/tree/main#system-requirements).
- You should have the latest version of Google Chrome installed.
- You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.
- You should have [`era_test_node`](https://docs.zksync.io/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node#install-and-set-up-era_test_node) installed.
- If you aren't familiar with paymasters and smart accounts on ZKsync Era, check out the
[General Paymaster](https://docs.zksync.io/build/start-coding/zksync-101/paymaster) and
[Native AA Multisig](https://code.zksync.io/tutorials/native-aa-multisig) tutorials.

## What You Will Build

In this tutorial, we will build an app that allows users to sign transactions with WebAuthn.

To break this down, the app will allow users to:

- Deploy a new instance of a smart account.
- Create a new WebAuthn passkey.
- Register the WebAuthn passkey as an authorized user of the smart account.
- Use WebAuthn to transfer ETH.
- Use WebAuthn to mint an NFT.
- Have gasless transactions.

## Introduction to WebAuthn

WebAuthn, short for Web Authentication API, is an API built-in to your browser that allows your app to register and authenticate users.
It allows users to authenticate using [passkeys](https://passkeys.dev/docs/intro/what-are-passkeys/),
including using biometric data (such as Apple's TouchID) or portable hardware devices (such as a Yubikey).

### Ceremonies

There are two steps, or "ceremonies", for using WebAuthn: registration and authentication.

1. The first step, registration, is when the user creates a new key pair specific to the application they are using.
2. The second step, authentication, is used to send a challenge to WebAuthn to sign using that key pair, and receive a signature in return.

In the frontend section, you will see in more detail what these ceremonies look like.

### Signatures

WebAuthn uses a different signature scheme than what is typically used in blockchain.
WebAuthn uses the secp256r1 elliptic curve for signing, while standard accounts in blockchain use the secp256k1 curve.

Without a helper function to handle verifying secp256r1 signatures, it can be really difficult to integrate a smart account with WebAuthn.
Luckily, we can utilize the `P256Verify` precompile to verify that a given WebAuthn signature matches a known public key.

In the next section, we will create the contracts for the app.
