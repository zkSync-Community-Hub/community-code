title: Send a transaction from L1 to L2
description: This how-to guide explains how to send a transaction from Ethereum that interacts with a contract deployed on ZKsync.
---

The [ZKsync Era smart contracts](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/tree/main/l1-contracts/contracts)
allow a sender to request transactions on Ethereum (L1) and pass data to a contract deployed on ZKsync Era (L2).

In this example, we'll send a transaction to an L2 contract from L1 using `zksync-ethers`, which provides helper methods to simplify the process.

## Common use cases

Along with ZKsync Era's built-in censorship resistance that requires multi-layer interoperability,
some common use cases need L1 to L2 transaction functionality, such as:

- Custom bridges.
- Multi-layer governing smart contracts.
