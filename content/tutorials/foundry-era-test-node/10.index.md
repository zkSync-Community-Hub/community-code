title: Interacting with Uniswap on a Fork of ZKsync Era Using era_test_node and Foundry
description: A step-by-step guide to set up a fork of ZKsync Era mainnet and interact with the Uniswap contract to perform token swaps using Foundry.
---

This tutorial shows you how to set up a local ZKsync Era environment using `era_test_node`,
leverage Foundry's `cast` tool to interact with contracts, and perform token swaps on Uniswap.
You'll learn how to:

1. Set up your development environment.
2. Streamline your workflow with environment variables.
3. Check balances using `cast call`.
4. Deposit ETH for WETH.
5. Transfer WETH to another address.
6. Swap WETH for an ERC20 token on Uniswap.

Let's get started!

**Security Tip**: Never commit your private key to version control or share it publicly.
Ensure your `.env` file is excluded from source control. `.env` should be used for
development purposes only, see the [foundry keystore](https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/foundry/installation#private-key-setup-with-foundry-keystore)
section of the docs for a more secure way to manage your private keys.

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

### Fork ZKsync Era Mainnet

Start `era_test_node` and fork ZKsync Era mainnet:

```bash
era_test_node fork mainnet
```

For debug mode (provides more transaction details and requires version `v0.1.0-alpha.27` or higher):

```bash
era_test_node -d fork mainnet
```

---

## 2. Streamlining with Environment Variables

Create a new project directory and a `.env` file in your project directory to store environment variables:

```bash
ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8011
PRIVATE_KEY=rich_wallet_private_key_here
ETH_GAS_LIMIT=10000000    # Optional
WETH=0x5AEa5775959fBC2557Cc8789bC1bf90A239D9a91
MY_ADDRESS=address_of_the_rich_wallet
SWAP_ROUTER=0x99c56385daBCE3E81d8499d0b8d0257aBC07E8A3
```

- **ETH_RPC_URL**: The URL of your local `era_test_node` instance.
- **PRIVATE_KEY**: One of the private keys from the `era_test_node` accounts.
- **ETH_GAS_LIMIT**: Optional gas limit for transactions.
- **WETH**: [WETH token address on ZKsync Era](https://era.zksync.network/address/0x5AEa5775959fBC2557Cc8789bC1bf90A239D9a91).
- **MY_ADDRESS**: The address of the rich wallet private key.
- **SWAP_ROUTER**: [Uniswap Swap Router contract address on ZKsync Era](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments/ZKsync-deployments).

Run the following in your terminal in your project directory to load the environment variables:

```bash
source .env
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
**Security Tip**: Never commit your private key to version control or share it publicly.
Ensure your `.env` file is excluded from source control. `.env` should be used for
development purposes only, see the [foundry keystore](https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/foundry/installation#private-key-setup-with-foundry-keystore)
section of the docs for a more secure way to manage your private keys.

## 3. Checking Balances

To check the ETH balance of an address:

```bash
cast balance $MY_ADDRESS
```

---

## 4. Depositing ETH for WETH

Deposit ETH and receive WETH by interacting with the WETH contract:

```bash
cast send $WETH "deposit()" --value 500000000000000000 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

- **Function**: `deposit()`
- **Value**: Amount of ETH to deposit (in wei). For example, `0.5 ETH` is `500000000000000000 wei`.

### Verify Your WETH Balance

Check your WETH balance:

```bash
cast call $WETH "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $MY_ADDRESS
```

---

## 5. Transferring WETH

To transfer WETH to another address:

```bash
cast send $WETH "transfer(address,uint256)" <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT_TO_TRANSFER> --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

- **`<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>`**: The address to send WETH to.
- **`<AMOUNT_TO_TRANSFER>`**: Amount of WETH to transfer (in wei).

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
**Check**: Use `cast call` to verify the transfer.
::

---

## 6. Approving WETH for Swapping

Before swapping WETH on Uniswap, approve the Swap Router to spend your WETH:

```bash
cast send $WETH "approve(address,uint256)" $SWAP_ROUTER <AMOUNT_TO_APPROVE> --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

- **`<AMOUNT_TO_APPROVE>`**: The amount of WETH you plan to swap (in wei).

---

## 7. Selecting an ERC20 Token and Swap Pair

### Find an ERC20 Token

- Use the [ZKsync Era Tokens List](https://explorer.zksync.io/tokens) to choose an ERC20 token.
- Set the ERC20 token address in your `.env` file:

```bash
ERC20=ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS_HERE
```

### Find the Uniswap Pool and Fee Tier

- Visit the [Uniswap Pools Explorer](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/zksync) to find a pool for your token pair.
- Note the **fee tier** of the pool (e.g., `3000` for 0.3% fee).
- Set the fee in your `.env` file:

```bash
FEE=FEE_TIER_HERE
```

---

## 8. Swapping WETH for an ERC20 Token

We'll use the `exactInputSingle` function from the Uniswap Swap Router contract. This function accepts a struct as a parameter.

### `exactInputSingle` Function Details

```solidity
function exactInputSingle(ExactInputSingleParams calldata params)
        external
        payable
        returns (uint256 amountOut);
```

**Struct Definition:**

```solidity
struct ExactInputSingleParams {
    address tokenIn;            // Token you're swapping from
    address tokenOut;           // Token you're swapping to
    uint24 fee;                 // Fee tier of the pool
    address recipient;          // Address to receive output tokens
    uint256 amountIn;           // Amount of input tokens to swap
    uint256 amountOutMinimum;   // Minimum amount of output tokens to receive
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96;  // Price limit for the swap (optional)
}
```

### Update the environment variables

Your `.env` file should now have the following variables:

```bash
ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8011
PRIVATE_KEY=rich_wallet_private_key_here
ETH_GAS_LIMIT=10000000    # Optional
WETH=0x5AEa5775959fBC2557Cc8789bC1bf90A239D9a91
MY_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_here
SWAP_ROUTER=0x99c56385daBCE3E81d8499d0b8d0257aBC07E8A3
ERC20=ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS_HERE
FEE=FEE_TIER_HERE
AMOUNT_IN=AMOUNT_OF_WETH_TO_SWAP_HERE
AMOUNT_OUT_MIN=MINIMUM_AMOUNT_OF_ERC20_TO_RECEIVE_HERE
SQRT_PRICE_LIMIT_X96=0
```

- **$AMOUNT_IN**: Amount of WETH to swap (in wei).
- **$AMOUNT_OUT_MIN**: Minimum amount of ERC20 tokens to receive (in wei). Use [Kraken Convert](https://www.kraken.com/convert) to estimate this amount.
- **$SQRT_PRICE_LIMIT_X96**: Set to `0` to accept current pool prices, or calculate based on desired price limit.

Load the environment variables:

```bash
source .env
```

### Execute the Swap Command

```bash
cast send $SWAP_ROUTER \
  "exactInputSingle((address,address,uint24,address,uint256,uint256,uint160))" \
  "($WETH,$ERC20,$FEE,$MY_ADDRESS,$AMOUNT_IN,$AMOUNT_OUT_MIN,$SQRT_PRICE_LIMIT_X96)" \
  --value 0 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-information-circle"}
**Note**: If something goes wrong:

- Check your `.env` file for mistakes
- Reload the environment variables
- Check the logs in the terminal where you started `era_test_node`

## Notes and Tips

- **EOA Restrictions**: Externally Owned Accounts can't interact directly with Uniswap V3 Pool
  contracts due to callback requirements. Use the Swap Router instead.
- **Understanding Tuples**: When calling functions that accept structs, parameters are passed
  as tuples enclosed in parentheses and quotes to prevent shell parsing issues.
- **Token Decimals**: Ensure you're using the correct number of decimals for your ERC20 token.
- **Gas Limit**: If you encounter gas limit issues, set `ETH_GAS_LIMIT` in your `.env` file.
- **Approvals**: Always approve the Swap Router to spend your tokens before swapping.
- **Cast Send**: The `cast send` command is used to send transactions. `--value 0` is used
  because we are swapping WETH for an ERC20 token, and we are not sending any ETH in this
transaction.
- **AI**: Utilize tools like ChatGPT for quick calculations andexplanations.

## Conclusion

You've successfully set up a local ZKsync Era environment, interacted with contracts using `cast`,
and performed a token swap on Uniswap. This setup allows you to test and develop smart contract
interactions in a controlled environment.
