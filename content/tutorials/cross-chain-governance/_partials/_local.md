### Starting a Local Node

Open Docker Desktop so the Docker daemon is running in the background,
and use `zksync-cli` to start a local node.

First, configure the CLI to use a dockerized node:

```bash
npx zksync-cli dev config 
```

Use the arrow key to select `Dockerized node` in the prompt.
To run a local block explorer, use the arrow keys and space bar to select the `Block Explorer` option in the prompt.
Finally, press the `Enter` key to confirm the configuration.

Once configured, start the local dockerized node.

```bash
npx zksync-cli dev start
```

  ```txt [L1-Governance/.env]
  :code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L1-governance/localenv.example"}
  ```
