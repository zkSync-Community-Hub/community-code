title: L1 governance contract
description: Build and deploy a smart contract in L1 and send transactions that update the state of a contract in ZKsync.
---

This tutorial shows you how to implement communication between L1 and L2 with the following example:

- A **Governance** Solidity smart contract is deployed on layer 1. This contract has a function that sends a transaction
  to ZKsync Era layer 2.
- A **Counter** Solidity smart contract is deployed on ZKsync Era layer 2. This contract stores a number that is incremented

  by calling the `increment` method. The `Governance` contract on layer 1 calls this function.
