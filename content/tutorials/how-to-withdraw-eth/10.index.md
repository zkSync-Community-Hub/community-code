title: Withdraw Ether from ZKsync
description: Learn how to create a script to withdraw Ether from ZKsync to Ethereum.
---

Withdrawing assets from Layer 2 (L2) back to Layer 1 (L1) is an essential procedure to retrieve your assets in ZKsync.
This guide outlines how to withdraw ETH using the ZKsync Javascript SDK, ensuring a successful transfer of assets to L1.
In ZKsync, withdrawing involves burning tokens on L2 and unlocking the corresponding funds on the L1 bridge.

## Prerequisites

- A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installation running at minimum Node.js version `18`.
- **Private Key**: Have access to a private key for the account you'll be using.
- **L1 RPC Endpoint**: A URL to an Ethereum node to interact with.
  You can find RPC endpoints for Sepolia and Ethereum mainnet on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) or use a node provider like Infura.

## Understanding L2 to L1 Withdrawals

Withdrawing assets from L2 to L1 involves the following steps:

1. **Burning L2 Tokens**: Initially, the specified tokens on L2 are burned.
2. **Sending L2 to L1 Message**: A message detailing the withdrawal is sent from L2 to L1.
3. **Finalizing Withdrawal**: The `finalizeWithdrawal` method is called on the L1 bridge to complete the withdrawal process,
  unlocking the funds from the L1 bridge and sending them to the recipient.

During the Alpha phase, **withdrawals in ZKsync Era take 24 hours** for additional security.

## Setup Environment

Create a new directory for your withdrawal scripts and navigate into it:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
mkdir withdraw-scripts && cd withdraw-scripts
npm init -y
npm i typescript ts-node zksync-ethers dotenv
```

```bash [yarn]
mkdir withdraw-scripts && cd withdraw-scripts
yarn init -y
yarn add typescript ts-node ethers zksync-ethers dotenv
```

::

Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root containing your private key and the L1 RPC endpoint:

```bash
WALLET_PRIV_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
L1_RPC_ENDPOINT=<RPC_URL>
```

## Create the Withdrawal Script

Create a new file `withdraw.ts` and insert the following code.
This script utilizes the `withdraw` method from the `Wallet` class of the ZKsync Javascript SDK to withdraw ETH.
Adjust the `AMOUNT` variable if necessary.

#### withdraw.ts script

```typescript
import { Wallet, Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
import * as ethers from "ethers";

// load env file
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

// HTTP RPC endpoints
const L1_RPC_ENDPOINT = process.env.L1_RPC_ENDPOINT || ""; // or an RPC endpoint from Infura/Chainstack/QuickNode/etc.
const L2_RPC_ENDPOINT = process.env.L2_RPC_ENDPOINT || "%%zk_testnet_rpc_url%%"; // or the ZKsync Era mainnet

// Wallet
const WALLET_PRIV_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIV_KEY || "";

// Amount in ETH
const AMOUNT = "0.00001";

if (!WALLET_PRIV_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Wallet private key is not configured in env file");
}

if (!L1_RPC_ENDPOINT) {
  throw new Error("Missing L1 RPC endpoint. Check chainlist.org or an RPC node provider");
}

async function main() {
  console.log(`Running script to withdraw ETH to L1`);

  // Initialize the wallet.
  const l1provider = new ethers.Provider(L1_RPC_ENDPOINT);
  const l2provider = new Provider(L2_RPC_ENDPOINT);
  const wallet = new Wallet(WALLET_PRIV_KEY, l2provider, l1provider);

  console.log(`L1 Balance is ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);
  console.log(`L2 Balance is ${await wallet.getBalance()}`);

  try {
    // withdraw ETH to L1
    const withdrawHandle = await wallet.withdraw({
      to: wallet.address, // can bridge to a different address in L1
      token: utils.ETH_ADDRESS,
      amount: ethers.parseEther(AMOUNT),
    });
    console.log(`Withdraw transaction sent ${withdrawHandle.hash}`);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error(`Error withdrawing: ${error.message}`);
    process.exitCode = 1;
  }
}

main()
  .then()
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
  });
```

## Run the Script

Execute the script using the following command:

```sh
npx ts-node withdraw.ts
```

## Verify the Output

Upon running the script, you should see an output similar to below, indicating the withdrawal transaction has been sent and is being processed on L1:

```txt
Running script to withdraw ETH to L1
L1 Balance is 6539874840163375070
L2 Balance is 5712612651486983637
Withdraw transaction sent 0x4905176d42b4c3b4ab10f611e688b2d849e761493f4583119b7c7731b4254cf4
```

## Finalize withdrawal script

Finalize withdrawal is the process that is run later on the L1 (once the L2 batches are proven), and which is actually responsible for transferring
the tokens into your account.

This part is permissionless - so anyone can trigger it. In sepolia, this is done by the cronjob, that is run by the community, but on all the other chains
(mainnet, local networks), you have to trigger it yourself.


### withdraw-finalize.ts script

```typescript
import { Wallet, Provider } from "zksync-ethers";
import * as ethers from "ethers";

// load env file
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

// HTTP RPC endpoints
const L1_RPC_ENDPOINT = process.env.L1_RPC_ENDPOINT || ""; // or an RPC endpoint from Infura/Chainstack/QuickNode/etc.
const L2_RPC_ENDPOINT = process.env.L2_RPC_ENDPOINT || "https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev"; // or the ZKsync Era mainnet

// Wallet
const WALLET_PRIV_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIV_KEY || "";


if (!WALLET_PRIV_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Wallet private key is not configured in env file");
}

if (!L1_RPC_ENDPOINT) {
  throw new Error("Missing L1 RPC endpoint. Check chainlist.org or an RPC node provider");
}

async function main() {
  // Please set your TX id, that you received from the withdraw.ts before.
  const WITHDRAW_TX = "<WITHDRAW_TRANSACTION>"

  console.log(`Finalizing withdrawal for ${WITHDRAW_TX}`);

  // Initialize the wallet.
  const l1provider = new ethers.Provider(L1_RPC_ENDPOINT);
  const l2provider = new Provider(L2_RPC_ENDPOINT);
  const wallet = new Wallet(WALLET_PRIV_KEY, l2provider, l1provider);

  const isFinalized = await wallet.isWithdrawalFinalized(WITHDRAW_TX);
  console.log("IS finalized ", isFinalized);

  if (isFinalized == true) {
    console.log("Your withdrawal is already finalized. Your tokens should be on L1");
    console.log(`L1 Balance is ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);
    console.log(`L2 Balance is ${await wallet.getBalance()}`);

  } else {
    console.log(`L1 Balance before is  ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);
    console.log("Finalizing withdrawal now");

    const result = await wallet.finalizeWithdrawal(WITHDRAW_TX);
    console.log("Waiting for tx :", result.hash);
    const receipt = await result.wait();

    console.log("Receipt status: ", receipt?.status)
    console.log(`L1 Balance after is  ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);
  }

}

main()
  .then()
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
  });
```

### Run the Script

Remember to set your withdrawal transaction from the previous step into the code at line 26 and execute the script using the following command:

```sh
npx ts-node withdraw-finalize.ts
```



## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully withdrawn ETH from L2 to L1 using the ZKsync Javascript SDK.
This is a significant step towards managing your assets on the ZKsync Era.
