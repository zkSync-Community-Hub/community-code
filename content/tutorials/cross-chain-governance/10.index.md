title: L1 governance contract
description: Build and deploy a smart contract in L1 and send transactions that update the state of a contract in ZKsync.
---

This tutorial shows you how to implement communication between L1 and L2 with the following example:

- A **Governance** Solidity smart contract is deployed on layer 1. This contract has a function that sends a transaction
  to ZKsync Era layer 2.
- A **Counter** Solidity smart contract is deployed on ZKsync Era layer 2. This contract stores a number that is incremented

  by calling the `increment` method. The `Governance` contract on layer 1 calls this function.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure your machine satisfies the [system
  requirements](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/tree/main#system-requirements).
- You are already familiar with deploying smart contracts on ZKsync Era.
  If not, please refer to the first section of the [quickstart tutorial](https://docs.zksync.io/build/start-coding/quick-start).
- You already have some experience working with Ethereum.
- A wallet with sufficient Sepolia `%%zk_testnet_currency_symbol%%` on Ethereum and %%zk_testnet_name%% to pay for deploying smart
  contracts. You can get Sepolia ETH from the [network faucets](https://docs.zksync.io/ecosystem/network-faucets).
  - Get testnet `ETH` for ZKsync Era using [bridges](https://zksync.io/explore#bridges) to bridge funds to ZKsync.
- You know how to get your [private key from your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

### Complete Project

Download the [complete project on GitHub](https://github.com/zksync-community-hub/community-code/tree/main/code/cross-chain-governance).

## Project Setup

Open a terminal window, create a new folder for the project tutorial, e.g. `mkdir cross-chain-tutorial`, and `cd` into
the folder.

Now create separate folders to store contracts and scripts on L1 and L2. For now we will start with L1-governance
folder.

```sh
mkdir L1-governance
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-circle"}
The `L1-governance` code is a default Hardhat project used to deploy a contract on L1.
The `L2-counter` code includes all ZKsync dependencies and configurations for L2.
::

## L1 Governance

1. `cd` into the `L1-governance` folder.

  ```sh
  cd L1-governance
  ```

1. Initialise and set up the L1 project.

  ```sh
  npx hardhat init
  ```

  Select the option **Create a Typescript project** and accept the defaults for everything else.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-circle"}
To interact with the ZKsync bridge contract using Solidity, you need
the ZKsync contract interface. There are two ways to get it:

- Import it from the `@matterlabs/zksync-contracts` npm package (preferred).
- Download it from the [contracts repo](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts).

::

1. Install the following dependencies:

  ::code-group

  ```bash [npm]
  npm i -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat typechain ethers dotenv
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn add -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat typechain ethers dotenv
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm add -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat typechain ethers dotenv
  ```

  ```bash [bun]
  bun add -D typescript ts-node @openzeppelin/contracts @matterlabs/zksync-contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat typechain ethers dotenv
  ```

### Create L1 Governance Contract

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
Make sure you're still in the `L1-governance` folder.
::

The following Solidity code defines the Governance smart contract.

The constructor sets the contract creator as the single governor.
The `callZkSync` function calls a transaction on L2 which can only be called by the governor.

1. Remove the existing `/test` directory and any contracts that exist in `/contracts`.

1. Create a new file called `Governance.sol` inside the empty `contracts` folder.

  ```sh
  touch contracts/Governance.sol
  ```

1. Copy/paste the code below into it.

```solidity [L1-governance/contracts/Governance.sol]
:code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L1-governance/contracts/Governance.sol"}
```

### Deploy L1 Governance Contract

1. Create the file `L1-Governance/.env` and copy/paste the code below, filling in the relevant values.
  Find node provider urls [here](https://chainlist.org/chain/11155111).
  You have to connect your wallet to the network and add the network to the wallet in advance.

    ```txt [L1-Governance/.env]
    :code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L1-governance/.env.example"}
    ```

1. Replace the code in `hardhat.config.ts` with the following:

    ```ts [L1-Governance/hardhat.config.ts]
    :code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L1-governance/hardhat.config.ts"}
    ```

1. Create the file `Governance.ts` inside the `/ignition/modules` folder and copy/paste the following code into it:

    ```sh
    touch ignition/modules/Governance.ts
    ```

    ```ts [L1-Governance/ignition/modules/Governance.ts]
    :code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L1-governance/ignition/modules/Governance.ts"}
    ```

1. From the `L1-governance` folder root, compile and deploy the contract:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx hardhat compile
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn hardhat compile
    yarn hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia
    ```

    ```sh [pnpm]
    pnpm hardhat compile
    pnpm hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia
    ```

    ```sh [bun]
    bun hardhat compile
    bun hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia
    ```

    ::

    You should see the following output:

    ```sh
    Deploying [ GovernanceModule ]
    Batch #1
      Executed GovernanceModule#Governance

    [ GovernanceModule ] successfully deployed 🚀

    Deployed Addresses

    GovernanceModule#Governance - 0xA7d27A1202bE1237919Cf2cb60970141100725b4
    ```

    Save the address to use in a later step.
