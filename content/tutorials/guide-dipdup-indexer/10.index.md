title: Create an indexer with DipDup
description: This page will guide you through the steps to get your first DipDup indexer up and running in a few minutes.
---

Let's create an indexer to track balances of particular token.
We will need to set up the indexing environment, configure the indexer, and store the results in a database.

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things you need to get started with DipDup:

- **Skills**: Basic Python 3 knowledge to implement data handlers.
- **Operating System**: You can use any Linux/macOS distribution on amd64/arm64 platforms with Python installed.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.11 is required for DipDup. You can check your Python version by running `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## Understanding DipDup

DipDup is a software framework that helps web3 developers create selective indexers for decentralized applications.
It uses blockchain data provided by various off-chain data sources.
Some of the key features of DipDup include:

- **Ready For Multichain**:
  DipDup supports dozens of blockchains, and we are constantly adding new ones.
  You can easily reuse your business logic for different networks or even index multiple chains in a single project.
- **Declarative Configuration**:
  A whole indexer is defined by a single configuration file and a bunch of Python data handlers.
  Code is completely separated from the configuration and environment variables, making it easy to maintain and deploy your project.
- **Lots of Integrations**:
  You can use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or TimescaleDB databases to store blockchain data,
  deploy to Compose or Swarm with a single command, monitor your indexer with Prometheus or Sentry, and more.
- **Magic GraphQL API**:
  DipDup automatically generates a GraphQL API for your data using Hasura, so you can easily query it from your frontend or other services.
  You can easily extend API with custom queries and metadata requests.
- **Powerful CLI**:
  DipDup CLI has everything you need to manage your project, from creating a new one to running and deploying.
  And it's very convenient. There are lots of templates for various blockchains and use cases, so you can start quickly.

## Install DipDup

The easiest way to install DipDup as a CLI application is [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) with `pipx install dipdup` command.
If you don't want to deal with tooling, we have a convenient installer script.
Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell [Terminal]
curl -Lsf https://dipdup.io/install.py | python3
```

See the [DipDup Installation](https://dipdup.io/docs/installation) page for other options.

## Create a project

DipDup CLI has a built-in project generator. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup new
```

In this guide we will use one of our demos - demo_evm_events as a template:
![Terminal output of `dipdup new` command](/images/dipdup/dipdupnew.png)

Dipdup will generate complete project structure, including USDT balances tracking logic,
which is implemented in demo. Let's look further into it in following steps.

## Configuration file

In the project root, you'll find a file named `dipdup.yaml`. It's the main configuration file of your indexer.
We will discuss it in detail in the [Config](https://dipdup.io/docs/getting-started/config) section;
for now just replace contract address with target token, I will use ZKsync USDT for this example:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
spec_version: 2.0
package: zksync_demo

datasources:
  subsquid:
    kind: evm.subsquid
    url: ${SUBSQUID_URL:-https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet}
    node: evm_node
  etherscan:
    kind: abi.etherscan
    url: ${ETHERSCAN_URL:-https://api.etherscan.io/api}
    api_key: ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY:-''}
  evm_node:
    kind: evm.node
    url: ${NODE_URL:-https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2}/${NODE_API_KEY:-''}
    ws_url: ${NODE_WS_URL:-wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2}/${NODE_API_KEY:-''}

contracts:
  eth_usdt:
    kind: evm
    address: 0x493257fD37EDB34451f62EDf8D2a0C418852bA4C
    typename: eth_usdt

indexes:
  eth_usdt_events:
    kind: evm.subsquid.events
    datasource: subsquid
    handlers:
      - callback: on_transfer
        contract: eth_usdt
        name: Transfer
```

## Implement handlers

Now, let's examine `handlers/on_transfer.py`.
As defined in `dipdup.yaml`, this handler is activated when the transfer method of the token contract is called.
In this guide, we focus on tracking USDT balances on ZKsync Era:

```py [on_transfer.py]
from decimal import Decimal

from tortoise.exceptions import DoesNotExist

from zksync_demo import models as models
from zksync_demo.types.eth_usdt.evm_events.transfer import Transfer
from dipdup.context import HandlerContext
from dipdup.models.evm_subsquid import SubsquidEvent


async def on_transfer(
    ctx: HandlerContext,
    event: SubsquidEvent[Transfer],
) -> None:
    amount = Decimal(event.payload.value) / (10**6)
    if not amount:
        return

    await on_balance_update(
        address=event.payload.from_,
        balance_update=-amount,
        level=event.data.level,
    )
    await on_balance_update(
        address=event.payload.to,
        balance_update=amount,
        level=event.data.level,
    )


async def on_balance_update(
    address: str,
    balance_update: Decimal,
    level: int,
) -> None:
    try:
        holder = await models.Holder.cached_get(pk=address)
    except DoesNotExist:
        holder = models.Holder(
            address=address,
            balance=0,
            turnover=0,
            tx_count=0,
            last_seen=None,
        )
        holder.cache()
    holder.balance += balance_update
    holder.turnover += abs(balance_update)
    holder.tx_count += 1
    holder.last_seen = level
    await holder.save()
```

Notice that we utilize the Transaction model predefined in `models/__init__.py`.
DipDup is compatible with several databases, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and TimescaleDB,
thanks to a custom ORM layer built on top of Tortoise ORM.
For more information on DipDup's data models and how to utilize them in your projects, visit the [models page in our docs](https://dipdup.io/docs/getting-started/models).

## Run

In 'dipdup.yaml' we have three datasources, in this tutorial we will use two of them:
Subsquid Network for historical data and JSON-RPC API (EVM node) for real-time and historical data.
Before running, set URLs for datasources.
These URLs can be set in `dipdup.yaml`, but here we suggest better .env file approach:

1. Copy `deploy/.env.default` file to `deploy/.env`.
1. Set `SUBSQUID_URL=https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/zksync-mainnet`.
1. Set your EVM node, for this example I will use the public RPC endpoint: `NODE_URL=https://mainnet.era.zksync.io`, `NODE_WS_URL=wss://mainnet.era.zksync.io`.

Start the indexer:

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup -e deploy/.env -c dipdup.yaml -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yaml run
```

Data will be stored in SQLite database. Run this query to check the data:

```bash
sqlite3 /tmp/zksync_demo.sqlite 'SELECT * FROM holder LIMIT 10'
```

The next part of the guide will explain how to start production-ready DipDup application in Docker environment with GraphQL API for your data.

### Query API

Most powerful and common DipDup application configuration uses PostgreSQL to store data and Hasura to have production ready API,
steps to deploy stack in Docker environment in a few simple steps:

1. Generate and set `HASURA_SECRET` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `deploy/.env` file, Hasura secret will be used later to access Hasura.
1. Build and start Docker containers: `docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d`.
1. Run `docker ps` to check that all containers are running. Locate the URL of the Hasura console in the PORTS column
  [compose.yml documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#ports).
  If the container isn't accessible via `0.0.0.0:PORT`, it may be accessible via `localhost:PORT` in certain environments.

1. As an example, let's query the first 10 addresses with a positive balance:
