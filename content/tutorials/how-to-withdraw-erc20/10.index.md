title: Withdraw ERC20 tokens from ZKsync
description: Learn how to create a script to withdraw any ERC20 token from ZKsync to Ethereum.

Withdrawing assets from Layer 2 (L2) back to Layer 1 (L1) is an essential procedure to retrieve your assets in ZKsync.
This guide outlines how to withdraw ETH using the ZKsync Javascript SDK, ensuring a successful transfer of assets to L1.
In ZKsync, withdrawing involves burning tokens on L2 and unlocking the corresponding funds on the L1 bridge.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed. If not, download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Private Key**: Have access to a private key for the account you'll be using.
- **L1 RPC Endpoint**: A URL to an Ethereum node to interact with.
  You can find RPC endpoints for Sepolia and Ethereum mainnet on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) or use a node provider like Infura.

## Understanding L2 to L1 Withdrawals

Withdrawing assets from L2 to L1 involves the following steps:

1. **Burning L2 Tokens**: Initially, the specified tokens on L2 are burned.
1. **Sending L2 to L1 Message**: A message detailing the withdrawal is sent from L2 to L1.
1. **Finalizing Withdrawal**: The `finalizeWithdrawal` method is called on the L1 bridge to complete the withdrawal process,
  unlocking the funds from the L1 bridge and sending them to the recipient.

During the Alpha phase, **withdrawals in ZKsync Era take 24 hours** for additional security.

## Setup Environment

Create a new directory for your withdrawal scripts and navigate into it:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
mkdir withdraw-erc20-script && cd withdraw-erc20-script
npm init -y
npm i typescript ts-node ethers@^5.7.2 zksync-ethers@5 dotenv
```

```bash [yarn]
mkdir withdraw-erc20-script && cd withdraw-erc20-script
yarn init -y
yarn add typescript ts-node ethers@^5.7.2 zksync-ethers@5 dotenv
```

::

Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root containing your private key and the L1 RPC endpoint:

```bash
WALLET_PRIV_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
L1_RPC_ENDPOINT=<RPC_URL>
```

## Create the Withdrawal Script

Create a new file `withdraw-erc20.ts` and insert the following code.
This script utilizes the `withdraw` method from the `Wallet` class of the ZKsync Javascript SDK to withdraw ETH.
Adjust the `AMOUNT` and `TOKEN_ADDRESS` variable if necessary.

#### withdraw-erc20.ts script

```typescript
import { Wallet, Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
import * as ethers from "ethers";

// load env file
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

// HTTP RPC endpoints
const L1_RPC_ENDPOINT = process.env.L1_RPC_ENDPOINT || ""; // or an RPC endpoint from Infura/Chainstack/QuickNode/etc.
const L2_RPC_ENDPOINT = process.env.L2_RPC_ENDPOINT || "%%zk_testnet_rpc_url%%"; // or the ZKsync Era mainnet

// ERC-20 Token address in L2
const TOKEN_ADDRESS = "<TOKEN_ADDRESS>";

// Amount of tokens
const AMOUNT = "5";

const WALLET_PRIV_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIV_KEY || "";

if (!WALLET_PRIV_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Wallet private key is not configured in env file");
}

if (!L1_RPC_ENDPOINT) {
  throw new Error("Missing L1 RPC endpoint. Check chainlist.org or an RPC node provider");
}

if (!TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
  throw new Error("Missing address of the ERC-20 token in L1");
}

async function main() {
  console.log(`Running script to bridge ERC-20 to L1`);

  // Initialize the wallet.
  const l1provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(L1_RPC_ENDPOINT);
  const l2provider = new Provider(L2_RPC_ENDPOINT);
  const wallet = new Wallet(WALLET_PRIV_KEY, l2provider, l1provider);

  console.log(`L1 Balance is ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);
  console.log(`L2 Balance is ${await wallet.getBalance()}`);

  // withdraw ERC-20 token to L2
  const withdrawErc20Handle = await wallet.withdraw({
    to: wallet.address, // can bridge to a different address in L1
    token: TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: ethers.utils.parseEther(AMOUNT), // assumes ERC-20 has 18 decimals
  });
  console.log(`Withdraw ERC-20 transaction sent ${withdrawErc20Handle.hash}`);
}

main()
  .then()
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
  });
```

## Run the Script

Execute the script using the following command:

```sh
npx ts-node withdraw-erc20.ts
```

## Verify the Output

Upon running the script, you should see an output similar to below, indicating the withdrawal transaction has been sent and is being processed on L1:

```txt
Running script to bridge ERC-20 to L1
L1 Balance is 19421054769191270
L2 Balance is 2969626077250000000
Withdraw ERC-20 transaction sent 0x280a2168f464c93e8c56df3291076bbb6cff78ebdc30fdaad22bc275d56aa3ed
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully withdrawn ERC-20 token from L2 to L1 using the ZKsync Javascript SDK.
This is a significant step towards managing your assets on the ZKsync Era.
