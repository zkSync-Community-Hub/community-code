title: L1-L2 transactions
description: Deploy a contract in ZKsync that has a counter.

## Call L2 Contract from L1

Now, let's call the `increment` method on Layer 2 from Layer 1.

1. Create a new file in the `scripts` folder named `increment-counter.ts`.

  ```sh
  touch scripts/increment-counter.ts
  ```

1. Copy and paste in the following code, replacing the following
   details:

    - GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L1.
    - COUNTER_ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L2.
    - `<YOUR_L1_RPC_ENDPOINT>`: your L1 RPC endpoint (if not deploying on a local node).

    ```ts [L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts]
    :code-import{filePath="cross-chain-governance/L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts"}
    ```

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    Executing transactions from L1 requires the caller to pay a fee to the L2 operator.
    The fee depends on the length of the calldata and the `gasLimit`.
    This is similar to the `gasLimit` on Ethereum.

    You can read more about the [ZKsync fee model here](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/fee-model).
    The fee also depends on the gas price that is used during the transaction call.
    So to have a predictable fee for the call, the gas price should be fetched from the L1 provider.
    ::

1. Run the script with the following command:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx hardhat run ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn hardhat run ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ```sh [pnpm]
    pnpm hardhat run ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ```sh [bun]
    bun hardhat run ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ::

    In the output, you should see the full transaction receipt in L2.
    You can take the `transactionHash` and track it in the [ZKsync explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).
    It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      to: '0x9b379893bfAD08c12C2167C3e3dBf591BeD9410a',
      from: '0xE2EA97507a6cb610c81c4A9c157B8060E2ED7036',
      contractAddress: null,
      transactionIndex: 0,
      root: '0xb9ca78c288163a322a797ee671db8e9ab430eb00e38c4a989f2246ea22493945',
      gasUsed: BigNumber { _hex: '0x05c3df', _isBigNumber: true },
      logsBloom: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
      blockHash: '0xb9ca78c288163a322a797ee671db8e9ab430eb00e38c4a989f2246ea22493945',
      transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',
      logs: [
        {
          transactionIndex: 0,
          blockNumber: 4119331,
          transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',
          address: '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000800A',
          topics: [Array],
          ...

    ```

1. Verify that the transaction was successful by running the `display-value` script again.
    You may have to wait a couple minutes for the counter to update.

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx hardhat run ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn hardhat run ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    ```sh [pnpm]
    pnpm hardhat run ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    ```sh [bun]
    bun hardhat run ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    ::

    You should see an incremented value in the output:

    ```txt
    The counter value is 1
    ```
