## Call L2 Contract from L1

Now, let's call the `increment` method on Layer 2 from Layer 1.

1. Copy the `abi` array from the compilation artifact located at:

`/L1-governance/artifacts/contracts/Governance.sol/Governance.json`.

You have to copy only abi content from the file after the keyword abi, an example below:

```json
[
  {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "newGovernance",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "constructor"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "governance",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "increment",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "value",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```

2. Paste it into a new file: `/L2-counter/scripts/governance.json`.

3. Create the `L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts` file and paste in the following code, replacing the following
   details:

- GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L1.
- COUNTER-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L2.
- WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY: the private key of your account.
- RPC-URL: the same url you used in the `sepolia.json` file.

```ts
import { Contract, Wallet, Interface } from "ethers";
import { Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
// load env file
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const GOVERNANCE_ABI = require("./governance.json");
const GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS = "<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>";
const COUNTER_ABI = require("./counter.json");
const COUNTER_ADDRESS = "<COUNTER-ADDRESS>";

const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY || "";
if (!PRIVATE_KEY) throw "⛔️ Private key not detected! Add it to the .env file!";
// Initialize the wallet.

async function main() {
  // Enter your Ethereum L1 provider RPC URL.
  const l1Provider = new Provider("<L1-RPC-URL>");
  // Set up the Governor wallet to be the same as the one that deployed the governance contract.
  const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, l1Provider);
  // Set a constant that accesses the Layer 1 contract.
  const govcontract = new Contract(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS, GOVERNANCE_ABI, wallet);

  // Initialize the L2 provider.
  const l2Provider = new Provider("https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev");
  // Get the current address of the zkSync L1 bridge.
  const zkSyncAddress = await l2Provider.getMainContractAddress();
  // Get the `Contract` object of the zkSync bridge.
  const zkSyncContract = new Contract(zkSyncAddress, utils.ZKSYNC_MAIN_ABI, wallet);

  // Encoding the L1 transaction is done in the same way as it is done on Ethereum.
  // Use an Interface which gives access to the contract functions.
  const counterInterface = new Interface(COUNTER_ABI);
  const data = counterInterface.encodeFunctionData("increment", []);

  // The price of an L1 transaction depends on the gas price used.
  // You should explicitly fetch the gas price before making the call.
  const gasPrice = await l1Provider.getGasPrice();

  // Define a constant for gas limit which estimates the limit for the L1 to L2 transaction.
  const gasLimit = await l2Provider.estimateL1ToL2Execute({
    contractAddress: COUNTER_ADDRESS,
    calldata: data,
    caller: utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS),
  });
  // baseCost takes the price and limit and formats the total in wei.
  // For more information on `REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT` see the [fee model documentation](../developer-guides/transactions/fee-model.md).
  const baseCost = await zkSyncContract.l2TransactionBaseCost(gasPrice, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT);

  // !! If you don't include the gasPrice and baseCost in the transaction, a re-estimation of fee may generate errors.
  const tx = await govcontract.callZkSync(zkSyncAddress, COUNTER_ADDRESS, data, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT, {
    // Pass the necessary ETH `value` to cover the fee for the operation
    value: baseCost,
    gasPrice,
  });

  // Wait until the L1 tx is complete.
  await tx.wait();

  // Get the TransactionResponse object for the L2 transaction corresponding to the execution call.
  const l2Response = await l2Provider.getL2TransactionFromPriorityOp(tx);

  // Output the receipt of the L2 transaction corresponding to the call to the counter contract.
  const l2Receipt = await l2Response.wait();
  console.log(l2Receipt);
}

// We recommend always using this async/await pattern to properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"} 
Executing transactions from L1 requires the caller to pay a fee to the L2
operator. The fee depends on the length of the calldata and the `gasLimit`. This is similar to the `gasLimit` on
Ethereum. You can read more about the [zkSync fee model here](../../developer-reference/fee-model.md). The fee also
depends on the gas price that is used during the transaction call. So to have a predictable fee for the call, the gas
price should be fetched from the L1 provider.

1. Run the script with the following command:

::code-group

```sh [npm]
npx ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
```
::

In the output, you should see the full transaction receipt in L2. You can take the `transactionHash` and track it in the
[zkSync explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/). It should look something like this:

```json

  logs: [
    {
      transactionIndex: 0,
      blockNumber: 4119331,
      transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',

      topics: [Array],
      ...

```

1. Verify that the transaction was successful by running the `display-value` script again.

```sh
npx ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
```

You should see an incremented value in the output:

```txt
The counter value is 1
```
